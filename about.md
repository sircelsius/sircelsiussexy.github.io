<p class="message">
  Ahoy! My name is Marc and I am an engineering student from France. This place is where I write stuff about my daily geek reveries.
</p>

I have always loved learning/sharing about software and web development using websites like the [Stack Exchange](http://stackexchange.com/) family, [GitHub](http://github.com) and various other personnal or business blogs.

I am currently working as a [Grails](https://grails.org/) developer for a french startup named [kazaden](http://kazaden.com/), and I love words like **ElasticSearch**, **Amazon Web Services**, or **Linux**.

When I'm not busy trying to get my old laptop to compile and run my projects, I like to go out and take [pictures](https://www.flickr.com/photos/marcduboucheron/), print them in my darkroom or read cool photography books. I also like enjoying a beer in front of a rugby game (Go [Clermont](http://www.asm-rugby.com/)) and listening to cool music.

Feel free to [contact me on twitter](http://twitter.com/MonsieurCelsius) if you want to chat about dev things and/or have a beer!

This site was built using [@mdo](http://twitter.com/mdo)'s  [Lanyon](https://github.com/poole/lanyon) and is hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). No kittens were harmed during development.
