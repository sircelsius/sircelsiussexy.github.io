    <p class="message">Over the weekend, I switched from the original jekyll build of the site to a new workflow using <em>bower</em> and <em>grunt</em>.</p>

<p>The original jekyll building process is cool, but it lacks a few things to make it really unforgettable. After playing around a bit with <em>liquid</em> tags to add some features to my pages, I thought I might need a bit more flexibility with dependency management and building / deploying.</p>

<p>To achieve that, here are the new features I have added:</p>

<ol>
<li>No github building of my jekyll. Only the compiled site is available on the repo&#39;s <code>master</code> branch.</li>
<li>Better dependency management with <code>bower</code>.</li>
<li>A new building and serving process using Grunt.</li>
<li>A couple of lesser features that are more the results of my messing around with the code than anything else:

<ul>
<li>Custom, per post scripts using Front Matter declarations. For example, this post includes a script named <code>bowergrunt.js</code>.</li>
<li>Ability to choose which bower dependencies are injected in a page. This post uses the <span data-d3="1">d3</span> <span data-d3="2">library</span> for example (These insanely well chosen colors are &quot;roboto&quot; and &quot;fedora&quot; from <a href="http://www.bada55.io">bada55.io</a>).</li>
<li>Only posts with the <code>published: true</code> property in their Front Matter declaration appear on the homepage. I&#39;m working on a way to completely disable unpublished posts from my building process soon.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<p>I&#39;ll be posting a comprehensive tutorial explaining how I got all this to work soon. In the meantime, know that it was largely inspired by the process described by <a href="http://www.aymerick.com">Aymerick</a> on this <a href="http://www.aymerick.com/2014/07/22/jekyll-github-pages-bower-bootstrap.html">blog post</a>.</p>

<p>Oh yeah, and I messed around with <a href="http://fezvrasta.github.io/bootstrap-material-design/">Bootstrap Material Design</a> a little. I don&#39;t know if I&#39;ll keep it or not.</p>

    <p class="message">Writing integration tests is sometimes pretty repetitive, especially if you have many domains that have custom CRUD methods. Here are a few snippets that I have found useful when creating <em>integration tests</em>.</p>

<p><em>These snippets will evolve with time, as I write more and more tests.</em></p>

<h2>Lists</h2>

<h3>size</h3>

<p>This requires a bit of logic to understand, but the idea is to verify that the list size is the minimum between the maximum size (set in <code>params</code> or as a default value) and the total number of domain objects <em>minus</em> the offset parameter (if it exists).</p>

<p class="description">This also works whatever the offset, max or number of domain objects. How cool is that?</p>

<p>This might seem a bit overkill upon reading it for the first time, but as it turns out, when testing large applications that have many dependencies between their different domains, with tests for domain <code>A</code> calling CRUD methods on domain <code>B</code> objects, being able to test domain <code>B</code> without knowing the <em>actual</em> number of objects that exist is paramount. There&#39;s nothing more annoying than writing a test that does something like the following and having to refactor it every day because some other test has added or removed objects:</p>

<h2>i18n messages</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>This assumes that your messages are present in your <code>message_fr.properties</code>. It doesn&#39;t have to be french though, I&#39;ll allow it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The testing process is separated in two parts: <strong>setting the request locale</strong> so that the tested method knows which message it should get, and <strong>testing the returned message</strong> to make sure that the method gets the correct value.</p>

<h3>Setting the request locale</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>Setting the locale can be done either globally for the entire test class or locally for a single method. Although I generally try to set my parameters locally, messages aren&#39;t <em>that</em> important, so I go with the first option</p>
</blockquote>

<span class="o">}</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p class="description">Set the request locale for the whole test class. Easy.</p>

<h3>Testing the returned messages</h3>

<p>Supposing you are testing a controller that render an i18n message in <code>flash.message</code>, you can test the message value the following way:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-groovy" data-lang="groovy"><span class="k">assert</span> <span class="n">controller</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">flash</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">message</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="n">messageSource</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">getMessage</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;your.message.label&quot;</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="o">[</span><span class="n">your</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="n">message</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="n">args</span><span class="o">]</span> <span class="k">as</span> <span class="n">Object</span><span class="o">[],</span> <span class="n">controller</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">request</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">getLocale</span><span class="o">())</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p class="description">Get a message in an integration test class</p>

<p>Let&#39;s cut that line in smaller pieces so as to better understand it.</p>

<p>We are calling the <code>org.springframework.context.messageSource.getMessage(String code, Object[] args, Locale locale)</code> (javadoc <a href="http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/context/MessageSource.html#getMessage-java.lang.String-java.lang.Object:A-java.util.Locale-">here</a>) method. The docs are pretty clear as to what this method does:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Try to resolve the message. Treat as an error if the message can&#39;t be found.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="description">Ok Spring, I get it.</p>

<p>The arguments we are passing to this method are the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>Your message&#39;s code. <em>Meh</em></li>
<li>Your message arguments, <code>as Object[]</code>. The casting is important here, or else you&#39;ll get nasty <code>groovy.lang.MissingMethodException</code> messages when running your tests, and they will fail. If the message you are testing doesn&#39;t take any argument, just go full badass style and set that to <code>null</code>.</li>
<li>Your <code>controller.request</code>&#39;s <code>Locale</code> which we set earlier. Just like for the arguments, if you feel like testing the default <code>Locale</code>, set this to <code>null</code>.</li>
</ol>

<p>This pretty cool snippet was originally given as an <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/27190531/3465375">answer</a> to one of my questions on stackoverflow. I have been using it ever since. Very love. Many useful. Wow. </p>

        Mac OS X case sensitivity and git

    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">10 Dec 2014</span>

    <p class="message">I love my new macbook. Just about as much as I hate it.</p>

<p>I recently bought a Macbook Pro because I had grown tired of my almost three years old and shitty - because I used it a lot, not because it was in the first place - HP Elitebook. I had been thinking about it for a while and I must say I am qui impressed. It is light and quick but most of all I love the fact that I found a *nix like terminal and general file structure. It feels right at home! I&#39;ll still install fedora soon enough because I can, but hey, it&#39;s been a week and I still haven&#39;t, who would have thought?</p>

<p>There is one thing that made me really mad though: the case insensitivity of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchical_File_System">HFS+ File System</a>. I mean seriously, where the fuck does that come from anyway? Why would anyone want that? The regular users wouldn&#39;t notice anything if it were different, and the more advanced users would never have problems similar to what I&#39;ll describe below.</p>

<p><img src="public/img/wtf.jpg" alt="Seriously Apple?"></p>

<h2>The git problem</h2>

<p>Sometimes, because of that case insensitivity, versioning systems - meaning git - get messed up pretty badly. </p>

<p>What happened to me was pretty insanely time consuming and enraging. Let&#39;s assume my git repo was in the following state:</p>

<ul>
<li>I had a file named <code>Foo.jpg</code> in my project, and I was working on branch <code>A</code>. The <code>Foo.jpg</code> file was not really my concern as it was an older file I had taken from the <code>master</code> branch earlier.</li>
<li>My coworker was working on branch <code>B</code>. He <em>deleted</em> <code>Foo.jpg</code> and created a new file in the same location named <code>foo.jpg</code>.</li>
<li>All my changes on branch <code>A</code> were commited, running <code>git status</code> showed me no changed files.</li>
</ul>

<p>However, whenever I tried to run <code>git checkout B</code>, the command failed with the following output:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">error: The following untracked working tree files would be overwritten by checkout:
    foo.bar
Please move or remove them before you can switch branches.
Aborting
</code></pre></div>
<p>What this message means is that when git tried to put the <code>foo.jpg</code> file from the <code>B</code> branch in my file system, it found that the file already existed in the working tree under <code>Foo.jpg</code> - because for the OSX File System, they are the same files - although it had not been added to the tracked files - because for git, <code>Foo.jpg</code> is not the same thing as <code>foo.jpg</code>.</p>

<p>At this point, you&#39;re probably thinking something similar to what I thought at the time this first happened to me:</p>

<p><img src="public/img/wtf2.jpg" alt="I have no idea what's happening">
<p class="description">wtf OSX?</p></p>

<h2>The non solution</h2>

<p>I started derping around on the internets to find out how to solve that problem. I found a <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4858047/git-error-the-following-untracked-working-tree-files-would-be-overwritten-by-ch">lot</a> <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/14283695/3465375">of</a> <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/23960663/3465375">things</a> on stackoverflow that try to explain the problem and give different workarounds.</p>

<p>It seems the accepted solution to this known problem is to set the git <code>ignorecase</code> option to <code>true</code>. Once again, I don&#39;t believe this is a <em>good</em> solution, or even a <em>solution</em>. I don&#39;t want my git to ignore case. I don&#39;t want it to consider <code>Foo.jpg</code> the same as <code>foo.jpg</code>. What if one day I decide I want to keep both files?</p>

<p>Another way of working around the problem that I found was to use a combination of <code>git mv</code> commands to rename the files letting git know they were changed. While this is a <em>more acceptable</em> solution, it doesn&#39;t answer my needs. I want this problem to <em>not happen anymore</em>.</p>

<p>At the moment I am considering creating a partition on my hard drive to store my git projects - but of course Yosemite makes it hard to shrink the current partition I have in order to create a new one. So much for the out of the box experience. </p>

<p>I hate my Mac.</p>
