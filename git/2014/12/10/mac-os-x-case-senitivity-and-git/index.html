  <p class="message">I love my new macbook. Just about as much as I hate it.</p>

<p>I recently bought a Macbook Pro because I had grown tired of my almost three years old and shitty - because I used it a lot, not because it was in the first place - HP Elitebook. I had been thinking about it for a while and I must say I am qui impressed. It is light and quick but most of all I love the fact that I found a *nix like terminal and general file structure. It feels right at home! I&#39;ll still install fedora soon enough because I can, but hey, it&#39;s been a week and I still haven&#39;t, who would have thought?</p>

<p>There is one thing that made me really mad though: the case insensitivity of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchical_File_System">HFS+ File System</a>. I mean seriously, where the fuck does that come from anyway? Why would anyone want that? The regular users wouldn&#39;t notice anything if it were different, and the more advanced users would never have problems similar to what I&#39;ll describe below.</p>

<p><img src="public/img/wtf.jpg" alt="Seriously Apple?"></p>

<h2>The git problem</h2>

<p>Sometimes, because of that case insensitivity, versioning systems - meaning git - get messed up pretty badly. </p>

<p>What happened to me was pretty insanely time consuming and enraging. Let&#39;s assume my git repo was in the following state:</p>

<ul>
<li>I had a file named <code>Foo.jpg</code> in my project, and I was working on branch <code>A</code>. The <code>Foo.jpg</code> file was not really my concern as it was an older file I had taken from the <code>master</code> branch earlier.</li>
<li>My coworker was working on branch <code>B</code>. He <em>deleted</em> <code>Foo.jpg</code> and created a new file in the same location named <code>foo.jpg</code>.</li>
<li>All my changes on branch <code>A</code> were commited, running <code>git status</code> showed me no changed files.</li>
</ul>

<p>However, whenever I tried to run <code>git checkout B</code>, the command failed with the following output:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">error: The following untracked working tree files would be overwritten by checkout:
    foo.bar
Please move or remove them before you can switch branches.
Aborting
</code></pre></div>
<p>What this message means is that when git tried to put the <code>foo.jpg</code> file from the <code>B</code> branch in my file system, it found that the file already existed in the working tree under <code>Foo.jpg</code> - because for the OSX File System, they are the same files - although it had not been added to the tracked files - because for git, <code>Foo.jpg</code> is not the same thing as <code>foo.jpg</code>.</p>

<p>At this point, you&#39;re probably thinking something similar to what I thought at the time this first happened to me:</p>

<p><img src="public/img/wtf2.jpg" alt="I have no idea what's happening">
<p class="description">wtf OSX?</p></p>

<h2>The non solution</h2>

<p>I started derping around on the internets to find out how to solve that problem. I found a <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4858047/git-error-the-following-untracked-working-tree-files-would-be-overwritten-by-ch">lot</a> <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/14283695/3465375">of</a> <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/23960663/3465375">things</a> on stackoverflow that try to explain the problem and give different workarounds.</p>

<p>It seems the accepted solution to this known problem is to set the git <code>ignorecase</code> option to <code>true</code>. Once again, I don&#39;t believe this is a <em>good</em> solution, or even a <em>solution</em>. I don&#39;t want my git to ignore case. I don&#39;t want it to consider <code>Foo.jpg</code> the same as <code>foo.jpg</code>. What if one day I decide I want to keep both files?</p>

<p>Another way of working around the problem that I found was to use a combination of <code>git mv</code> commands to rename the files letting git know they were changed. While this is a <em>more acceptable</em> solution, it doesn&#39;t answer my needs. I want this problem to <em>not happen anymore</em>.</p>

<p>At the moment I am considering creating a partition on my hard drive to store my git projects - but of course Yosemite makes it hard to shrink the current partition I have in order to create a new one. So much for the out of the box experience. </p>

<p>I hate my Mac.</p>
